Demonstrates accessibility improvments to existing code.

## Description
This project takes the existing code for the home page of an online marketing firm and adds a variety of accessibility features without changing the appearance of the site. These features ensure that the site is available and easy to use for individuals with disabilities. Websites that are ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant also rank higher in search engine results, improving company visibility.

## Usage
Accessibility is greatly improved through the use of sematic tags in place of non-descriptive div tags. These tags also can greatly simplify the structure and readability of code, making it easier for the developer to follow as well. For example:

```md
![Div tag example](/assets/images/div-tag.JPG)
```

```md
![Semantic tag example](/assets/images/semantic-tag.JPG)
```

Another improvement can be made through the use alt text on an image. This allows for text readers to describe what is being displayed for the visually impared. Having semantic elements enclosing the image greatly aids in directing the individual through the page as well. For example:

```md
![Figure and image alt text example](/assets/images/figure-image.JPG)
```
